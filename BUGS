Bug-testing Programs ||
=======================

Unix Frotz now comes with crashme, TerpEtude, gntests, and strictz.
These are intended to excercise the interpreter and verify that it is
functioning according to spec.  You will find these programs in bugtest/.


==================
Screen Resizing ||
==================

There are some significant problems involved in getting screen resizes (as
in resizing an xterm) to work correctly at least with Frotz's
implementation of the Z-Machine and probably the Z-Machine standard
itself.  For this reason, I have not implemented screen resizing for
Frotz.  I know that some zcode interpreters are able to deal with resizes
somewhat gracefully, but I haven't seen one yet that will handle some
weirder situations.  Infocom's "Border Zone" and "Beyond Zork are
especially troublesome for doing resizes.  Nitfol seems to have the best
handling of screen resizes.  Since it uses the Glk library, I'm inclined
to think the Glk library is at least partially responsible.  If you have
any other ideas on how to cleanly resize screens, I'd like to hear them.

The Z-Machine seems to assume that when the screen dimensions are set,
they will never change over the course of the game, even across saves and
restores.  For some reason, saves include screen dimensions and I've yet
to discover how to override the Z-Machine from setting its dimensions to
the saved ones instead of how the current screen really is.  When the
Z-Machine was first defined by Infocom, this made sense since terminal
screens rarely, if ever, changed their dimensions and few people were
assumed to trade saves across platforms.


==================================
OSS sound on non-Linux machines ||
==================================

The only machines using the OSS drivers I can test sound on are Linux/x86,
NetBSD/x86, and Sparcs running NetBSD.  The sound from the NetBSD machines
sounds horrrible (twice as slow, full of static).  I'm not sure what the
problem is.  So far, I haven't heard of anyone trying sound on machines
other than Linux/x86.


=====================
Arrow Key Handling ||
=====================

Not really a bug, but an idiosyncracy.  In "Journey", sometimes you can't
use the right-arrow key to move from the "party commands" menu to the
"individual commands" menu.  IMHO, this is a bit sloppy, but it isn't
Frotz's fault.  Instead, use the spacebar to jump from menu to menu.
I mistakenly attributed this to an unknown bug.  That'll teach
me to do bugtesting when I'm about to nod off to sleep.


===================
Other Known Bugs ||
===================

Sound flag is not being set properly.

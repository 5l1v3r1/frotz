Stuff to do for a minor update ||
=================================

Frotz has so far, been completely configurable throught the command-line.
When I added the config file support, I noticed the need to add overrides
for some options like "color", "sound", and "ascii".  This sort of thing
is exhausting available command-line switches.

Remove debug options from command line.  They should be set through the
hotkey menu instead

Hotkey menu needs work.

Add zlib support to allow Frotz to read gzipped story files.

Add support for debug verbs (teleport, pilfer, bamf, (frotz|futz|lumen),
tail, travis, lummox, systolic, lingo, spiel, rooms, items, omap,
embezzle).  I really like the Rezrov's cheat functions.

Add an option to define the type of machine the Z-Machine is running on
(DECsystem 20, AppleIIe, etc).  Using the wrong machine for certain V6
games might cause trouble and this is a rather frivilous option, so I'll
let it go for now.

Add support for more sound drivers, not just OSS.
	OSS audio on bigendian machines doesn't seem to work!

Fix bugs!  (see file BUGS)


===================================================
Stuff to do for the next major release (ie 2.50) ||
===================================================

More sensible handling of saves, transcripts, and game files.  This might
be best handled by doing a complete rewrite of the Unix-specific code,
which probably ought to be done anyhow.

Curses menu to select desired game.  Current working code heavily borrows
from Alan Shutko's <ats@hubert.wustl.edu> "int-fiction" frontend program.

Blorb gamefile support.

Blorb sound support on all platforms.

An X11 graphical interface using GTK widgets (thus allowing V6 full support).

=========================================
Stuff that would be really really nice ||
=========================================

MacOS X support.  Hey, it's Unix!
BeOS support.  I guess it's close enough to Unix.

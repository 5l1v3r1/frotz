Hi David,

This is the KDE port guy again.

I want to be able to close one story file and open a new one, all without
exiting the main program.

For this to work, I had to modify the last line in interpret() in
process.c from

finished--;

to

finished = 0;

Otherwise the static variable 'finished' ends up as 9998 when starting the
second story, instead of the correct value of 0.

Perhaps useful to include in the reference implementation?

Cheers,

Peter

Things to do and bugs to investigate
------------------------------------

* Write sound support.  This is on hold until frotz supports the new "Blorb"
  format.

* Border Zone has a strange status line feature, mixing bright and dull
  whites.  Not sure what's going on here.

* Add support for GNU readline/history libraries instead of the kludgy
  editing routines I wrote.  If I can manage this, I'll probably release
  it as a patch rather than part of a release.
